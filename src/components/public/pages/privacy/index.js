      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Additional Disclosures for UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) Compliance</h3>
      <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Data Controller / Data Processor</h4>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The GDPR distinguishes between organisations that process personal information for their
        own purposes (known as &#34;data controllers&#34;) and organizations that process personal
        information on behalf of other organizations (known as &#34;data processors&#34;). For the purposes
        covered by this Privacy Policy, we are a Data Controller with respect to the personal
        information you provide to us and remain compliant with our data controller obligations under
        GDPR.
      </p>
      <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Third-Party Provided Content</h4>
      <p className="mb-4">
        We may indirectly collect personal information about you from third-parties who have your
        permission to share it. For example, if you purchase a product or service from a business
        working with us, and give your permission for us to use your details in order to complete the
        transaction.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        We may also collect publicly available information about you, such as from any social media
        and messaging platforms you may use. The availability of this information will depend on both
        the privacy policies and your own privacy settings on such platforms.
      </p>
      <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Additional Disclosure for Collection and Use of Personal Information</h4>
      <p className="mb-4">
        In addition to the aforementioned purposes warranting the collection and use of personal
        information, we may also conduct marketing and market research activities, including how
        visitors use our site, website improvement opportunities and user experience.
      </p>
      <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Personal Information No Longer Required for Our Purposes</h4>
      <p className="mb-4">
        If your personal information is no longer required for our stated purposes, or if you instruct us
        under your Data Subject Rights, we will delete it or make it anonymous by removing all
        details that identify you (&#34;Anonymisation&#34;). However, if necessary, we may retain your
        personal information for our compliance with a legal, accounting, or reporting obligation or for
        archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific, or historical research purposes or
        statistical purposes.
      </p>
      <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Legal Bases for Processing Your Personal Information</h4>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Data Protection and Privacy Laws permit us to collect and use your personal data on a limited
        number of grounds. In which case, we will collect and use your personal information lawfully,
        fairly and in a transparent manner. We never directly market to any person(s) under 18 years
        of age. Our lawful bases depend on the services you use and how you use them. This is a non-exhaustive list of the lawful bases we use:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Consent From You:</strong> Where you give us consent to collect and use your personal
          information for a specific purpose. You may withdraw your consent at any time using the
          facilities we provide; however this will not affect any use of your information that has already
          taken place.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Performance of a Contract or Transaction:</strong> Where you have entered into a contract
          or transaction with us, or in order to take preparatory steps prior to our entering into a contract
          or transaction with you.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Our Legitimate Interests:</strong> Where we assess it is necessary for our legitimate interests,
          such as for us to provide, operate, improve and communicate our services.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Compliance with Law:</strong> In some cases, we may have a legal obligation to use or keep
          your personal information.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">International Transfers of Personal Information</h4>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The personal information we collect is stored and/or processed in the United Kingdom by us.
        Following an adequacy decision by the EU Commission, the UK has been granted an
        essentially equivalent level of protection to that guaranteed under UK GDPR.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        On some occasions, where we share your data with third parties, they may be based outside
        of the UK, or the European Economic Area (&#34;EEA&#34;). These countries to which we store,
        process, or transfer your personal information may not have the same data protection laws as
        the country in which you initially provided the information.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        If we transfer your personal information to third parties in other countries:
        <ul>
          <li>we will perform those transfers in accordance with the requirements of the UK GDPR (Article 45) and Data Protection Act 2018;</li>
          <li>we will adopt appropriate safeguards for protecting the transferred data, including in transit, such as standard contractual clauses (&#34;SCCs&#34;) or binding corporate rules.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Your Data Subject Rights</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Right to Restrict Processing:</strong> You have the right to request that we restrict the processing
        of your personal information if (i) you are concerned about the accuracy of your personal
        information; (ii) you believe your personal information has been unlawfully processed; (iii) you
        need us to maintain the personal information solely for the purpose of a legal claim; or (iv) we
        are in the process of considering your objection in relation to processing on the basis of
        legitimate interests.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Right to Object:</strong> You have the right to object to processing of your personal information that
        is based on our legitimate interests or public interest. If this is done, we must provide
        compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which overrides your interests, rights, and
        freedoms, in order to proceed with the processing of your personal information.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Right to be Informed:</strong> You have the right to be informed with how your data is collected,
        processed, shared and stored.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Right of Access:</strong> You may request a copy of the personal information that we hold about you
        at any time by submitting a Data Subject Access Request (DSAR). The statutory deadline for
        fulfilling a DSAR request is 30 calendar days from our receipt of your request.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Right to Erasure:</strong> In certain circumstances, you can ask for your personal data to be erased
        from the records held by organisations. However this is a qualified right; it is not absolute,
        and may only apply in certain circumstances.
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>When the personal data is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was originally collected or processed for.</li>
        <li>If consent was the lawful basis for processing personal data and that consent has been withdrawn.</li>
        <li>The Company is relying on legitimate interests as a legal basis for processing personal data and an individual has exercised the right to object and it has been determined that the Company has no overriding legitimate grounds to refuse that request.</li>
        <li>Personal data are being processed for direct marketing purposes e.g. a person&#39;s name and email address, and the individual objects to that processing.</li>
        <li>There is legislation that requires that personal data are to be destroyed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Right to Portability:</strong> Individuals have the right to get some of their personal data from an
        organisation in a way that is accessible and machine-readable, for example as a csv file.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        However, the right to portability:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>Only applies to personal data which a person has directly given to MOVEMINT APP INC. in electronic form; and</li>
        <li>Onward transfer will only be available where this is &#34;technically feasible&#34;.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Right to Rectification:</strong> If personal data is inaccurate, out of date, or incomplete, individuals
        have the right to correct, update or complete that data. Collectively this is referred to as the
        right to rectification. Rectification may involve filling the gaps i.e. to have to have incomplete
        personal data completed – although this will depend on the purposes for the processing. This
        may involve adding a supplementary statement to the incomplete data to highlight any
        inaccuracy or claim thereof.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        This right only applies to an individual&#39;s own personal data; a person cannot seek the
        rectification of another person&#39;s information.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Notification of data breaches:</strong> Upon discovery of a data breach, we will investigate the
        incident and report it to the UK&#39;s data protection regulator and yourself, if we deem it
        appropriate to do so.

      <h2>Additional Disclosures for Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) Compliance (Canada)</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Additional scope of personal information:</strong> In accordance with PIPEDA, we broaden our definition of personal information to include any
        information about an individual, such as financial information, information about your
        appearance, your views and opinion (such as those expressed online or through a survey),
        opinions held about you by others, and any personal correspondences you may have with us.
        While this information may not directly identify you, be aware that it may be combined with
        other information to do so.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        As PIPEDA refers to personal information using the term Personally Identifying Information
        (PII), any references to personal information and PII in this privacy policy, and in official
        communications from MOVEMINT APP INC., are intended as equivalent to one another in every
        way, shape and form.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Valid Consent:</strong> Where you give us consent to collect and use your personal information for a specific
        purpose. You may withdraw your consent at any time using the facilities we provide; however
        this will not affect any use of your information that has already taken place. When you
        contact us, we assume your consent based on your positive action of contact, therefore you
        consent to your name and email address being used so we can respond to your enquiry.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Under PIPEDA, consent is only valid if it is reasonable to expect that an individual to whom the
        organization's activities are directed would understand the nature, purpose, and
        consequences of the collection, use, or disclosure of the personal information to which they
        are consenting.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Where you agree to receive marketing communications from us, we will do so based solely on
        your indication of consent or until you instruct us not to, which you can do at any time.
        While you may request that we delete your contact details at any time, we cannot recall any
        email we have already sent. If you have any further enquiries about how to withdraw your
        consent, please feel free to enquire using the details provided in the Contact Us section of this
        privacy policy.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>International Transfers of Information:</strong> While MOVEMINT APP INC. endeavors to keep, store and handle customer data within
        locations in Canada, it may use agents or service providers located in the United States (U.S.),
        European Economic Area (EEA) or United Kingdom (UK) to collect, use, retain and process
        personal information as part of providing services to you. While we use all reasonable efforts
        to ensure that personal information receives the same level of security in any other
        jurisdiction as it would in Canada, please be aware that privacy protections under U.S. laws
        may not be the same adequacy.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Customer Data Rights:</strong> Although PIPEDA does not contain an extensive set of consumer rights, it does grant
        consumers the right to:
        <ul>
          <li>Access the personal information organizations hold about them;</li>
          <li>Correct any inaccurate or outdated personal information the organization holds about them;</li>
          <li>Withdraw consent for any activities for which they have consented (e.g. direct marketing or cookies).</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Right to Withdraw Consent:</strong> Where you give us consent to collect and use your personal information for a specific
        purpose. Subject to some restrictions, you can, at any time, refuse to consent, or continue to
        consent to the collection, use or disclosure of their personal information by notifying us using
        the email address below in the ‘Contact Us&#39; section. Withdrawal of consent may impact our
        ability to provide or continue to provide services.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Customers cannot refuse collection, use and disclosure of their personal information if such
        information is required to:
        <ul>
          <li>Be collected, used or disclosed as required by any law;</li>
          <li>Fulfill the terms of any contractual agreement;</li>
          <li>Be collected, used or disclosed as required by any regulators including self-regulatory organizations.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Right of Access under PIPEDA:</strong> PIPEDA gives you a general right to access the PII held by businesses subject to this law.
        Under PIPEDA, you need to make your access request in writing and pay a minimal fee of
        $30.00.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        If any organizational fees seem unjust, you have the right to complain about this. We retain
        the right to decide how we disclose the copies of your PII to you. We will take all necessary
        measures to fulfill your request in 30 days from receipt, otherwise we must inform you of our
        inability to do so before the 30-day timeframe if:
        <ul>
          <li>Meeting the time limit would unreasonably interfere with our business activities; or</li>
          <li>The time required to undertake consultations necessary to respond to the request would
            make it impractical to meet the time limit.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Right of Rectification under PIPEDA:</strong> You may request a correction to any factual errors or omissions within your PII. We would ask
        you to provide some evidence to back up your claim. Under PIPEDA, an organization must
        amend the information, as required, if you successfully demonstrate that it&#39;s incomplete or
